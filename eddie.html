		<h3>Intro:</h3>
		<p class="myIntro">	Welcome to my custom made website, in here you will find a little bit of information about me, some of my life
		experiences, things of interest, activities, hobbies, movies and so on. You also might encounter a few of my own programmed
		projects that I make myself do. Any little thing I come up with I might upload into a separate page so that you guys (the readers)
		have an opportunity to see my creations if you wish. I might even link up my YouTube account in here so that you guys can see some of my
		videos, which are basically recorded game-play of me flying simulators. Thats another thing, I love flying, it has become an addiction
		of mine in the past 14 years.

		<h3>About me:</h3>
			<p class="aboutMe">
				Hey there, my name is Eddie L. Andino (Sounds a bit weird when I introduce myself by including my middle initial L. which stands for Lazaro) I was born
			in May 5th, 1997. Currently as I write this page section I am 20 years old and in third year of college, first year in FGCU. As you can probably tell because
			of this page I programmed myself, I am studying for a degree in computer Software Engineering. Once I complete my degree, I plan to major in a more specific
			area of software. Those are my long term goals that I write about on this site. Before I started at FGCU, I was in Florida SouthWestern State College (FSW) and
			I took some classes in there and I also got my first job there as a math tutor in the math center, I worked there for about a year until I switched to FGCU and
			now I am working in the math center here at this school. It is a fun job, you get to help people, and you get to know them. Aside from that, I have a few
			hobbies that I can talk about in here, and one of those is flying, I absolutely love flying. I am currently working on my Private Pilot License (PPL) and I
			have some hours and money invested into it already. This leads to my other hobby, flight simulators such as Flight Simulator X also get a tight hold of my
			attention.
			</P>
