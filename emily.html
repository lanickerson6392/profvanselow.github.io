      <h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I am currently a freshman at Florida Gulf Coast University. My major is in software engineering, with a soon-to-be minor in mathematics.</p>
		<p>I first learned about coding when I was 12 years old. I used to manipulate simple HTML and CSS code on a blogging website back then. After that experience, I instantly fell in love with coding. I knew it was something I definitely wanted to pursue in college.</p>
		<p>When I entered high school I decided to join the STEM program and the Engineering Team that was offered. Participating in these activities really made me realize that engineering and computer science are huge passions of mine!</p>
